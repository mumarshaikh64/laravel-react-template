                            You have worked hard to qualify as a holistic practitioner and will already have your own professional standards, however unforeseen and unpredictable things can and sometimes do occur. The tendency and unfortunate trend of the public to seek legal action against professionals appears to be increasing, especially with the promotion of the no win, no fee culture that we are currently undergoing. The number of insurance claims made against therapists is rising and large sums of money are sometimes claimed for minor damages. For your sake and your clients we advise that you always take out insurance.

                            <strong> Do I need to be a member of UHPC to obtain insurance?</strong>  As an accredited member with UHPC we work closely with insurance providers to ensure our members have access to the best insurance cover available. However, it is important to note that UHPC is not an insurance company. Instead, we provide accreditation and support to practitioners and training providers in the holistic and wellbeing sector.  For any enquiries related to insurance, we recommend contacting the insurance provider directly. You can find a list of our affiliate and recommended providers in your members dashboard. You do not need to be a registered member of UHPC to request insurance and you may contact them directly below. However members of UHPC do have the benefit of obtaining a discount on their insurance quote and will have a number of insurance providers to choose from.  Members will have access to a private members area and can then obtain insurance with discounts  of up to 12% included in your quote.

                            For members of UHPC then the answer is yes  - Our recommended providers cover members in the UK, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Australia, New Zealand & most of Europe. You have the freedom to choose any insurance provider that best suits your needs. Showing them you are a registered member of UHPC will usually result in them being happy to offer this but UHPC make no guarantees.  While we can't always recommend specific insurance providers, we encourage you to research options in your area. If you find a company you're satisfied with, please let us know. We'd be happy to consider listing them as a resource for other professionals.
